In Spring, we can let the container automatically inject the dependencies using the **`autowire`** attribute in the `<bean>` tag.

So instead of manually using `<constructor-arg>` or `<property>`, we can tell Spring to do it for us based on matching **name**, **type**, or **constructor**.

There are mainly **3 common autowiring modes**:

---

`autowire="byName"`

- Spring checks the bean's property name.
- If thereâ€™s another bean with the **same ID as the property name**, Spring will inject that bean automatically.

 *So here, the name of the property and the bean ID in the XML should be the same.*

```xml
<bean id="employee" class="com.myproject.Employee" autowire="byName"/>
<bean id="address" class="com.myproject.Address"/>

If Employee class has a property named address, and there is a bean with id="address", Spring will inject it automatically.
