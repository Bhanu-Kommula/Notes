So now we know that we can Spring core module can handle the inversion of control and dependency injection.  

So we can achieve this in 3 primary was

<b> 
1 — XML-Based Configuration
 We define the beans and their dependencies inside an XML file (usually applicationContext.xml or similar).

2 — Annotation-Based Configuration
We define the beans and their dependencies using annotations in a configuration class (like with @Configuration, @Bean, etc.).

3 — Java-Based Configuration
 We define the beans and their dependencies using annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Autowired directly on Java classes.
