1. Producer
➡️ The sender
➡️ Sends data (called messages or events) to Kafka
➡️ Example: Order service sends "Order #123 placed"

🔹 2. Topic
➡️ A named category for messages
➡️ Like folders: "orders", "payments", "emails"
➡️ Messages are organized here so consumers know where to look

🔹 3. Partition
➡️ A sub-division of a topic
➡️ Increases speed and scalability
➡️ Each partition stores messages in order
➡️ Kafka spreads messages across partitions

🔹 4. Offset
➡️ A number given to each message inside a partition
➡️ Acts like a bookmark
➡️ Helps consumers know:

Where they stopped

Where to start again

Or how to replay old messages

🔹 5. Broker
➡️ A Kafka server
➡️ Stores partitions and serves data
➡️ A Kafka cluster has multiple brokers for fault tolerance

🔹 6. Consumer
➡️ The receiver
➡️ Reads data from a topic
➡️ Example: Billing system reads new orders

🔹 7. Consumer Group
➡️ A team of consumers working together
➡️ Kafka divides partitions between them
➡️ Helps in parallel processing of data

💡 Real-Time Data Flow Summary:

Producer → sends data → Topic → split into Partitions → stored in Brokers
Consumers (in a group) → read data from Partitions using Offsets

no of pertitions per topic
There’s no fixed limit on the number of partitions per topic — you can define as many partitions as you want, based on your system’s performance and use case.

🔍 Now, let’s break it down properly.
Let’s say you have two topics in your Kafka system:

orders → this stores events like:

Order Placed

Order Cancelled

Order Updated

order_delivered → this stores events like:

Order Delivered

Delivery Failed

Now you’re wondering:

How many partitions should I give to each topic?

🧠 It depends on how much data and traffic each topic will handle.
📌 Example Scenario:
Let’s say:

Your app gets 10,000 new orders per minute

But only 7,000 deliveries happen per minute

Then you might configure like this:

Topic	Number of Partitions	Why?
orders	6 partitions	More traffic, needs better parallelism
order_delivered	3 partitions	Fewer messages, lower processing load
        
        
        # orders topic with 6 partitions
        kafka-topics.sh --create --topic orders --partitions 6 --replication-factor 2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
        
        # order_delivered topic with 3 partitions
        kafka-topics.sh --create --topic order_delivered --partitions 3 --replication-factor 2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
When deciding how many partitions, consider:
Factor	Effect
🚀 More throughput needed	➝ Use more partitions
👥 More consumers available	➝ Use more partitions (1 per consumer)
💾 Storage pressure	➝ Partition messages across brokers
⌛ Message ordering needed	➝ Fewer partitions (ordering is per partition)

⚠️ Important Notes:
Each partition runs in parallel, but ordering is guaranteed only within a single partition, not across them.

More partitions = better parallelism, but too many can increase overhead (like metadata, network, disk usage).

In production, it’s common to start with 6, 8, or 12 partitions, and scale later if needed.

✅ Final Thoughts:
Each topic can have as many partitions as you decide.

For your case:

orders topic → maybe 6 partitions (because more order events)

order_delivered topic → maybe 3 partitions

These numbers are tunable anytime based on load tests.






Lesson 3: Kafka Topics – Retention, Compaction, Configuration – Explained Naturally via Example
🛒 Scene: You're Building "ShopNow" (an Online Shopping Platform)
Imagine you're a backend developer for a company called ShopNow.

When a user places an order, the following events happen:

The frontend app sends order details to the backend

The backend saves the order

The billing service generates an invoice

The email service sends a confirmation email

The analytics system logs the event for business reports

💭 You say: "I don’t want all services to talk to each other directly — it's too risky. I’ll use Kafka!"

Great decision.

🧩 Step 1: Let’s create our first Kafka Topic – order_events
You create a topic named order_events where the Order Service (Producer) will push events like:

json
Copy
Edit
{ 
  "eventType": "ORDER_PLACED", 
  "orderId": 101, 
  "userId": 55, 
  "totalAmount": 120.5 
}
This topic now acts like a public announcement board for anyone who wants to listen to new orders.

Now multiple services become Consumers of order_events:

Billing Service

Email Notification Service

Analytics Pipeline

🎯 Now let’s say a question arises:
“How long will this order message stay in Kafka?”

Welcome to the concept of...

🕒 Retention in Kafka
Kafka is not like a queue where a message is deleted immediately after being read.

By default, Kafka keeps messages for a certain time or size — this is called Retention.

Let’s say you want the order_events topic to keep data for 7 days.

That means:

Even after the Billing Service reads the message

And even if the Email Service reads it

The message still lives in Kafka for 7 days

Why? Because maybe analytics missed it and wants to replay it later. Kafka makes that possible.

🛠 You configure it like this:
bash
Copy
Edit
kafka-configs.sh --alter --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--entity-type topics --entity-name order_events \
--add-config retention.ms=604800000
This sets retention time to 7 days (in milliseconds).

You can also configure retention by size, like:

bash
Copy
Edit
--add-config retention.bytes=104857600  # 100MB
🔁 Scenario Change: A New Problem Arises
Let’s say your topic has millions of small updates, like:

"Order viewed"

"Order clicked"

"Order summary refreshed"

But you only care about the latest status of each order.

That means you want to store only the most recent event for each key — and remove the old ones.

This brings us to the next concept...

🧹 Log Compaction in Kafka
Kafka has a special feature called Compaction.

💡 Instead of deleting messages after X days, Kafka remembers only the last value for each unique key (like orderId).

📦 Example:
json
Copy
Edit
{ "key": "order#101", "status": "PLACED" }
{ "key": "order#101", "status": "PACKED" }
{ "key": "order#101", "status": "DELIVERED" }
After compaction, only this will be kept:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "key": "order#101", "status": "DELIVERED" }
Kafka automatically removes the old ones.

🎯 When to use?
For state tracking

For latest status per ID

For cache sync with microservices

🔧 How to enable compaction?
bash
Copy
Edit
kafka-configs.sh --alter --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--entity-type topics --entity-name order_status_updates \
--add-config cleanup.policy=compact
You can even combine both:

bash
Copy
Edit
cleanup.policy=delete,compact
🧾 Naming Topics in Real Projects
As your system grows, you’ll create more topics. Keep them clear and consistent:

Topic Name	Purpose
order_events	All new order activity
order_status_updates	Latest order state with compaction
billing_events	Invoices, payment success/failure
email_notifications	Email service messages
product_inventory	Stock in/out updates

Use lowercase with underscores or dots like:

shopnow.order.events

shopnow.billing.transactions

Avoid:

Spaces

Special characters

Uppercase

📌 Recap – What We Learned Today in Story Format
✔ You created a topic order_events
✔ You learned Kafka retains messages (retention period, size)
✔ You faced a challenge where old data wasn't useful → learned compaction
✔ You saw how naming and topic design grows


Lesson 3 (Revisited): Kafka Topic Retention, Compaction & Configuration – Full Example
🛒 Scene: You’re Still Building ShopNow
Let’s continue from the same point.

So far, you've:

Created a Kafka topic called order_placed

Your OrderService (Producer) sends events into this topic

Other services like Invoice, Email, Analytics are Consumers, each in their own consumer group

All good so far ✅

Now you start asking deeper questions:

❓Question 1: “How long does Kafka keep my messages in the topic?”
Let’s say your topic order_placed receives thousands of messages every hour.

If Kafka stores everything forever, the disk will fill up.
If it deletes too soon, consumers might miss messages.

So how do we control this?

🧠 Welcome to: Retention in Kafka
Kafka gives you full control over:

How long a message should be kept in a topic

How much size the topic is allowed to use

🕒 1. Time-Based Retention (retention.ms)
This is the most common setting.

Example:

“Keep every message for 7 days, even after it is read.”

You set it like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
kafka-configs.sh --alter --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--entity-type topics --entity-name order_placed \
--add-config retention.ms=604800000
That’s 7 days (in milliseconds).

So if:

Order #101 was placed on June 10 at 1:00 PM

It will stay in Kafka until June 17 at 1:00 PM

Even if all consumers already read it, Kafka holds it — in case someone needs to replay or reprocess it.

💾 2. Size-Based Retention (retention.bytes)
Let’s say you don’t care about time, only size. You can say:

“Only allow 1GB of data per topic — delete old stuff after that.”

bash
Copy
Edit
--add-config retention.bytes=1073741824  # 1GB
You can also combine time and size — whichever comes first, Kafka cleans up.

🧹 So what happens when time/size limit is crossed?
Kafka automatically deletes old messages — starting from the oldest offset.

No need for cron jobs or scripts. It's handled internally and efficiently.

🔁 Let’s add a twist: Another Topic with Order Status Updates
You now introduce a second topic: order_status_updates

This topic stores:

order #101 → PLACED

order #101 → SHIPPED

order #101 → DELIVERED

You suddenly realize:

“I don’t care about the entire history. I only care about the latest status of each order.”

🧠 That brings us to: Log Compaction in Kafka
Log compaction is NOT based on time or size.
It is based on message key.

Kafka says:

“For every unique key (e.g., orderId), I’ll keep only the latest message.”

📦 Example:
Topic: order_status_updates

Kafka receives:

json
Copy
Edit
{ key: "order101", value: "PLACED" }
{ key: "order101", value: "SHIPPED" }
{ key: "order101", value: "DELIVERED" }
{ key: "order202", value: "PLACED" }
After compaction, Kafka keeps:

json
Copy
Edit
{ key: "order101", value: "DELIVERED" }
{ key: "order202", value: "PLACED" }
Older messages for the same key are removed (compacted).

🎯 When to Use Log Compaction?
When you’re storing the latest state per key

Like: user profile, product inventory, payment status, order status

Perfect for microservice-to-microservice state sync

🔧 How to Enable Compaction?
By default, Kafka deletes messages.

To enable compaction:

bash
Copy
Edit
kafka-configs.sh --alter --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--entity-type topics --entity-name order_status_updates \
--add-config cleanup.policy=compact
Or combine both:

bash
Copy
Edit
--add-config cleanup.policy=compact,delete
🧾 Topic Naming Tips (Pro Tip)
As your app grows, your topics might look like:

Topic Name	Purpose
shopnow.order_placed	Order created event
shopnow.order_status	Latest status of each order
shopnow.billing_events	Payments, invoice generated
shopnow.email_events	Emails to be sent
shopnow.analytics_raw	Raw logs for analysis

Use:

Lowercase names

Dots or underscores

Prefix by domain (like shopnow.)

Avoid:

Spaces

Uppercase

Random topic names

🧠 Final Recap: Kafka Storage = Smart + Configurable
Feature	Description
retention.ms	Keep messages for X milliseconds (time-based retention)
retention.bytes	Limit total topic size in bytes
cleanup.policy=compact	Keep only latest value for each key
cleanup.policy=delete	Default policy — delete based on time/size
Compaction	Best for state updates per ID
Retention	Best for event history and replay capability

🔚 Conclusion (Real World Flow)
order_placed topic → Uses time-based retention (7 days)
🔁 Because we want event history for billing, email, analytics

order_status_updates topic → Uses log compaction
🔁 Because we only care about latest status per orderId

🎓 Lesson 4: Writing a Kafka Producer using Java + Spring Boot    -- coding ask chatgprt if needed



✅ Lesson 5: Writing a Kafka Consumer using Java + Spring Boot (Invoice Service)  - coding ask chatgprt if needed



Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, and Schema Registry
Explained in-depth like a 10–15 years experienced backend engineer, with real examples and use cases.

🔌 1. Kafka Connect – The Data Pipe Worker
📖 What is Kafka Connect?
Kafka Connect is a tool to move data between Kafka and external systems — like databases, files, cloud services — without writing custom code.

🧠 It's part of the Kafka ecosystem — not a framework you write code in, but a system you configure with JSON.

🛠️ Common Use Cases:
From	To	Example Use Case
MySQL / Oracle	Kafka	Send new DB rows to Kafka topic
Kafka	ElasticSearch / MongoDB	Stream orders to search engine
Kafka	S3 / HDFS	Archive messages for analytics
Kafka	PostgreSQL / BigQuery	Store processed results in DB

⚙️ How It Works:
Kafka Connect runs:

Source Connectors (pull from external system → Kafka)

Sink Connectors (Kafka → external system)

Example: MySQL → Kafka → MongoDB

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Source: MySQL DB
       ⬇
   Kafka Topic: order_placed
       ⬇
Sink: MongoDB collection: orders
🔧 How to Use?
You define a connector like this (JSON or REST API):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "mysql-orders-connector",
  "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
  "tasks.max": "1",
  "database.hostname": "localhost",
  "database.user": "root",
  "database.password": "root",
  "database.server.id": "1",
  "database.include.list": "ecommerce",
  "table.include.list": "orders",
  "database.history.kafka.topic": "dbhistory.orders",
  "database.server.name": "mysql",
  "topic.prefix": "dbserver1"
}
✅ Connectors run as separate JVM workers (distributed or standalone)

🔄 Real-Time Benefit
Instead of writing:

JDBC + Polling logic + retry handling

✅ Kafka Connect does it for you with configuration only

🧩 2. Kafka Streams – The Real-Time Processing Engine
📖 What is Kafka Streams?
Kafka Streams is a Java library to build real-time streaming applications on top of Kafka.

It lets you:

Filter

Join

Group

Count

Window

Aggregate

Enrich

… all in real time, as data flows through Kafka.

⚙️ Simple Example: Count Orders Per City
java
Copy
Edit
KStream<String, Order> orders = builder.stream("order_placed");

KTable<String, Long> ordersPerCity = orders
    .map((key, order) -> KeyValue.pair(order.getCity(), order))
    .groupByKey()
    .count();

ordersPerCity.toStream().to("orders_by_city", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));
🔄 Kafka Streams Features:
Feature	Supported? ✅
Stateful operations	✅ Yes (e.g., aggregates, joins)
Fault-tolerant	✅ Yes
Distributed processing	✅ Yes
Runs in your app	✅ (no separate cluster needed)
Uses Kafka only	✅ All data input/output via Kafka

🔥 Real Examples:
Task	Kafka Streams Does?
Filter fraudulent orders	✅ Yes
Enrich order with customer info	✅ Yes
Calculate 5-min rolling count	✅ Yes
Join orders with payments	✅ Yes
Group items sold per product	✅ Yes

⚖️ Streams vs Connect:
Kafka Connect	Kafka Streams
Data integration tool	Data processing library
Move data in/out of Kafka	Process data inside Kafka
Declarative config (JSON)	Java code

🧾 3. Schema Registry – Contract Keeper of Kafka
📖 What is Schema Registry?
A central service to manage data schemas (like Avro/JSON/Protobuf) so Kafka Producers and Consumers agree on message format.

🧠 It avoids breaking consumers when producers change message structure.

💥 Problem Without Schema Registry:
Let’s say:

Old Producer sends: { orderId, amount }

New Producer sends: { orderId, amount, currency }

Old Consumer fails: "Unknown field: currency"

✅ Solution: Use Schema Registry
Schema Registry lets you:

Register a schema (Avro/Protobuf)

Track versions

Control compatibility (backward, forward, full)

🔧 How It Works
You define schemas (usually in Avro)

Producers & Consumers serialize/deserialize using the Schema ID

Schema Registry handles the rest

🔍 Compatibility Modes:
Mode	Allows?
Backward	Old consumers read new data ✅
Forward	New consumers read old data ✅
Full	Both ✅
None	❌ No compatibility enforced

🧪 Sample Avro Schema (order.avsc)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "Order",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "orderId", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "amount", "type": "double" }
  ]
}
🔌 Integration Example:
java
Copy
Edit
props.put("key.serializer", KafkaAvroSerializer.class);
props.put("value.serializer", KafkaAvroSerializer.class);
props.put("schema.registry.url", "http://localhost:8081");
✅ Now Producer sends data with schema info
✅ Consumer fetches schema and deserializes safely

✅ Final Summary: What Each One Does
Tool	Purpose	Tech Type	Your Role
Kafka Connect	Connect Kafka with external systems	Config-driven tool	Setup connectors
Kafka Streams	Process Kafka data in real time	Java SDK/library	Write stream logic
Schema Registry	Enforce and manage data formats	Server + API	Register schemas & integrate Avro/Protobuf

💡 Real-Time Flow in a Modern Microservices System:

[ MySQL DB ] → (Kafka Connect) → Kafka Topic (order_placed)
                                      ↓
                               Kafka Streams (filter, join)
                                      ↓
                          Kafka Topic (enriched_orders)
                                      ↓
                     (Kafka Connect Sink) → PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch






🔹 7. Key Kafka Configs (Must Know!)


1. replication.factor
Defines how many copies of each partition are stored across brokers

If replication.factor = 3, then each partition is stored on 3 different brokers (1 leader + 2 replicas)

Protects against broker failure

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
--replication-factor 3
✅ Use 3 in production for fault-tolerance
❌ If you use 1, there's no failover if the broker dies

🔹 2. retention.ms
How long Kafka keeps messages in a topic (in milliseconds)

After this time, old messages are deleted automatically (log cleanup)

Does not affect consumers if they read within time

Example:

properties
Copy
Edit
retention.ms = 604800000  # 7 days
✅ Use shorter retention for logs, longer for audit
🔥 For infinite storage, use retention.ms = -1 (not common)

🔹 3. acks
How many brokers must acknowledge before a message is considered written

Value	Behavior	Reliability
0	Producer doesn't wait (fire & forget)	❌ Low
1	Leader acknowledges write	⚠️ Medium
all	All in-sync replicas must ack	✅ High

Best practice:

properties
Copy
Edit
acks = all
Use with min.insync.replicas for strong durability

🔹 4. min.insync.replicas
Minimum number of replicas (including leader) that must acknowledge the write

Used with:

properties
Copy
Edit
acks = all
If fewer than this number are in sync → Kafka rejects the write

Prevents data loss during failover

Example:

properties
Copy
Edit
min.insync.replicas = 2
✅ Ensures at least 2 brokers confirm the write
🔥 If only 1 is alive, Kafka throws exception, protecting data

🔹 5. compression.type
Reduces the size of messages sent to Kafka

Options:

none (default)

gzip

snappy

lz4

zstd (Kafka 2.1+)

Example:

properties
Copy
Edit
compression.type = snappy
✅ Reduces bandwidth and disk usage
✅ Best for high-throughput topics

🔹 6. max.poll.records
Controls how many records a consumer fetches in one poll()

Example:

properties
Copy
Edit
max.poll.records = 500
✅ Controls batch size
✅ Smaller value → less memory use
✅ Larger value → higher throughput

⚠️ Must tune with:

max.poll.interval.ms (timeout)

Consumer processing time

🧠 Summary Table (Quick Recall)
Config	Purpose	Best Practice Setting
replication.factor	Data availability	3 (prod)
retention.ms	Data expiry policy	7 days or per topic requirement
acks	Write safety level	all (for durability)
min.insync.replicas	Minimum brokers to sync write	2 (with acks=all)
compression.type	Reduce message size & bandwidth	snappy or lz4
max.poll.records	Batch size for consumer	300-1000 depending on throughput






🔹 11. Pub/Sub vs Message-Driven Architecture
1️⃣ Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe Architecture)
📖 What is it?
A messaging model where publishers send messages to a topic, and multiple subscribers listen and receive those messages independently.

🔁 Real Example:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Service A (Publisher)
    → Kafka Topic: order_placed
        → Invoice Service (Subscriber)
        → Email Service (Subscriber)
        → Analytics Service (Subscriber)
🔸 Each subscriber:

Gets its own copy of the message

Is independent of others

✅ Characteristics
Feature	Pub/Sub Behavior
Message distribution	One-to-many (fan-out)
Tight coupling?	❌ No – very loose
Message storage	Centralized (Kafka topic)
Delivery	Each subscriber gets the full message
Subscriber failures	Do not affect others
Kafka consumer setup	Each subscriber = different consumer group

✅ Advantages
Easy to scale horizontally

High flexibility for microservices

One event → multiple actions

Great for event-driven systems

2️⃣ Message-Driven Architecture (MDA)
📖 What is it?
A design style where components communicate only via messages, never by direct calls. It’s more about architecture, not just messaging pattern.

🧠 Think of MDA as a larger design that:
Uses Pub/Sub or Queues internally

Ensures loose coupling between components

Services are completely decoupled and triggered by messages

💡 Real Example (MDA in Kafka):
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Frontend Order UI
    → Kafka Producer → Topic: order_placed

Microservices:
    → InvoiceService (Consumer) acts on the message
    → PaymentService (Consumer) acts independently
    → EmailService (Consumer) sends confirmation
No service calls another. All are driven by messages only.

✅ Characteristics of Message-Driven Architecture:
Feature	MDA Behavior
Communication style	Asynchronous, via messages
Service coupling	Loosely coupled (event-driven)
Reliability & durability	Achieved using Kafka or message brokers
Failover	Services fail independently
Trigger mechanism	Messages received from a queue or topic
Common Tools	Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, SQS, etc.

✅ Advantages
Fully async, decoupled services

Easy to scale or replace services

Ideal for microservices, event sourcing, CQRS

Improves resilience and fault tolerance

🧠 Pub/Sub vs Message-Driven Architecture – Key Differences
Feature	Pub/Sub	Message-Driven Architecture (MDA)
Scope	Messaging Pattern	Whole system design style
Core Idea	One event → many consumers	Entire services respond to messages only
Communication Style	Asynchronous	Asynchronous
Focus	Message delivery	Message triggered service design
Usage	Inside MDA or standalone	Uses pub/sub or queues internally
Examples	Kafka topics → Invoice, Email services	Whole app built using Kafka event triggers

✅ Final Summary (Simple Words):
Statement	True for Pub/Sub?	True for MDA?
One event triggers multiple services	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Designed to decouple whole services	❌ No	✅ Yes
Uses Kafka topics and consumer groups	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Entire system designed to respond to messages	❌ No	✅ Yes
Suitable for event-driven microservices	✅	✅✅✅

🔥 Analogy:
Example	Pub/Sub	MDA
YouTube channel sends a video	Everyone subscribed gets it individually	Each viewer decides what to do after viewing
Group WhatsApp message	All members see the message	Each one acts independently (reply, forward, etc.)



What is Apache Zookeeper?
Zookeeper is a centralized coordination service used by distributed systems (like Kafka) to manage and store metadata, leader election, and configuration in a consistent and fault-tolerant way.

Kafka used Zookeeper from the beginning to manage cluster state.

🎯 Why Kafka Used Zookeeper (Earlier Architecture)
Before KRaft, Kafka did not manage its metadata directly. Instead, it relied on Zookeeper for:

Role	Description
🔄 Broker registration	Track which brokers are alive in the cluster
👑 Leader election	Elect partition leaders among brokers
📄 Metadata management	Store topic names, configs, partition assignments
🔐 ACLs / security rules	Store access control information
🧠 Controller coordination	Decide which broker acts as controller (managing partition leaders)

🛠️ Example Workflow (Old Architecture):
Let’s say:

You create a topic order_placed

Here’s what happens:

Kafka broker contacts Zookeeper

Zookeeper stores:

Topic name

Partitions count

Replication info

Kafka uses this to assign partitions and elect leaders

⚠️ Drawbacks of Zookeeper
Problem	Description
Extra infrastructure	Kafka + Zookeeper → harder setup & ops
Split-brain risk	Inconsistent cluster states if not synced well
Scaling problems	Zookeeper doesn't scale well with thousands of topics
Harder upgrades/failures	Zookeeper failures can block Kafka
Increased DevOps complexity	Another system to monitor and tune

✅ Replaced by: KRaft Mode
Starting in Kafka 3.4+, Kafka introduced:

KRaft = Kafka + Raft (no Zookeeper)

In KRaft mode:

Kafka stores all metadata in its own internal quorum

No more external dependency

Controller role is now handled internally

🧠 Summary Comparison: Kafka with Zookeeper vs KRaft
Feature	Zookeeper Mode	KRaft Mode
Needs Zookeeper?	✅ Yes	❌ No
Metadata stored in	Zookeeper	Kafka internal log (Raft)
Leader election by	Zookeeper	Kafka controller (Raft)

Partition assignment stored in	Zookeeper	Kafka metadata quorum
Simpler deployment?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Future of Kafka	Deprecated	✅ Default (Kafka 3.6+)

🔐 Real World Tip:
Zookeeper is still in use in many older production clusters, but if you're:

Creating new Kafka clusters

Working in cloud-native systems

👉 Use KRaft to avoid Zookeeper entirely.





        
        
What is acks in Kafka?
acks (short for acknowledgments) is a Kafka producer configuration that controls how many brokers must confirm receipt of a message before the producer considers the write successful.

In simple terms:
"When can I be sure my message is safe?" — acks answers this.

🔍 Kafka acks – Available Options
Value	Meaning	Durability	Performance
0	Producer doesn't wait for any broker reply	❌ Lowest	🔥 Fastest
1	Producer waits for Leader Broker only	⚠️ Medium	⚡ Fast
all or -1	Producer waits for all in-sync replicas (ISR)	✅ Highest	🐢 Slower

✅ Let’s break each one down:
🔹 1. acks=0 → Fire & Forget
java
Copy
Edit
props.put("acks", "0");
Producer sends the message and moves on immediately

Kafka does NOT send back any response

If the broker is down → message is lost silently

✅ Ultra-fast, used in logging or metrics
❌ No delivery guarantee

🔹 2. acks=1 → Leader Acknowledges
java
Copy
Edit
props.put("acks", "1");
Producer sends to Kafka

Leader broker only acknowledges back

If leader crashes before replicating, data is lost

✅ Balanced choice: fast + some safety
❌ Not fully safe in production

🔹 3. acks=all or acks=-1 → All In-Sync Replicas Must Acknowledge
java
Copy
Edit
props.put("acks", "all");
Producer sends to Kafka

Kafka waits until all ISR replicas have written the data

Only then sends ACK to producer

✅ Strong durability
✅ No data loss even if leader dies

❗ Slower due to coordination with replicas

🧠 Real World Example (3-Broker Cluster)
Let’s say:

Replication Factor: 3

ISR = Broker 1 (Leader), Broker 2, Broker 3

min.insync.replicas = 2

With acks=all:
Kafka requires at least 2 brokers (ISR) to confirm the message write

Only then is the message considered successfully written

If only 1 ISR is alive → write fails with NotEnoughReplicasException

🛡️ Best Practice in Production
Setting	Recommended For
acks=all	✅ Critical data, payments, audit logs
acks=1	⚠️ Medium importance (e.g., product logs)
acks=0	❌ Only for fire-and-forget metrics

Combine with:

properties
Copy
Edit
acks = all
min.insync.replicas = 2
retries = 3
enable.idempotence = true
To make producer 100% reliable 🔒

What Does Kafka Send Back to the Producer When Using acks?
When a producer sends a message, Kafka responds with an acknowledgment (ACK) based on your acks setting.

✅ Step-by-Step Real-Time Example: acks=all
Scenario:
Kafka Cluster with 3 brokers

Topic: order_placed

Replication Factor: 3

acks = all

min.insync.replicas = 2

ISR (In-Sync Replicas): Broker 1 (Leader), Broker 2, Broker 3

🔁 Real-Time Flow When Producer Sends a Message:
🔹 Step 1: Producer sends this message
json
Copy
Edit
{ "orderId": "ORD123", "amount": 450.00 }
To: order_placed topic, partition 0

🔹 Step 2: Kafka Leader Broker (say, Broker 1) receives it
Broker 1 writes it to its local log

Then sends this message to ISR replicas (Broker 2 & 3)

🔹 Step 3: Replicas (Broker 2 & 3) write it
Replicas append it to their log

Send back internal ACK to Broker 1

🔹 Step 4: Broker 1 (Leader) receives both ACKs
Now it sees:
✅ All required in-sync replicas have the message

It sends a final ACK back to the Producer

📨 What Does the Producer Get in ACK?
The producer receives a RecordMetadata object like this:

java
Copy
Edit
RecordMetadata {
  topic: "order_placed",
  partition: 0,
  offset: 12345,
  timestamp: 1713456789000
}
✅ This tells the producer:

The message was successfully written

Stored at offset 12345 in partition 0

🔄 What if a Replica Is Down?
If you’re using:

properties
Copy
Edit
acks = all
min.insync.replicas = 2
If only 1 replica is alive: ❌ Kafka won’t send ACK

Producer gets an exception like:

java
Copy
Edit
NotEnoughReplicasException
➡️ So you know the message is not safe → retry or log it

💡 Real-Time Insight
acks Value	What Kafka Sends Back to Producer
0	❌ Nothing (fire & forget)
1	✅ Confirmation from leader only
all	✅ Confirmation from all ISRs

✅ Real Producer Code Example:
java
Copy
Edit
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("acks", "all");
props.put("retries", 3);
props.put("enable.idempotence", true);

Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

ProducerRecord<String, String> record =
    new ProducerRecord<>("order_placed", "ORD123", "{...json...}");

producer.send(record, (metadata, exception) -> {
    if (exception == null) {
        System.out.println("✅ Sent to partition " + metadata.partition() +
                           " with offset " + metadata.offset());
    } else {
        System.out.println("❌ Send failed: " + exception.getMessage());
    }
});
🔐 Bonus Tip: Combine With Idempotence

When a Replica Goes Down — What Happens?
❓ Q: If a replica broker goes down, will Kafka reassign replicas using Zookeeper (or KRaft)?
YES — but not instantly.
Kafka doesn't immediately reassign just because a replica is down. It follows strict rules and safety checks before triggering failover or replacement.

Let’s break it down:

🧠 Step-by-Step Flow: Replica Down + acks = all
🔹 Setup:
Replication factor = 3

ISR = Broker 1 (Leader), Broker 2, Broker 3

acks=all

min.insync.replicas=2

🔴 Step 1: Broker 3 Goes Down
Kafka marks Broker 3 as out of sync (not in ISR)

ISR now = [Broker 1, Broker 2]

Writes still succeed ✅ because ISR ≥ min.insync.replicas

✅ Kafka continues operations
❌ But no rebalancing or re-replication happens immediately

🔸 Step 2: If a Second Broker Goes Down
ISR becomes less than min.insync.replicas

Now, producer with acks=all ❌ fails with NotEnoughReplicasException

🛠️ Step 3: Who Manages Failover?
Mode	Who Reassigns Replica / Elects Leader?
🐘 Zookeeper	Kafka controller broker via Zookeeper
⚡ KRaft	Kafka controller uses Raft protocol

Kafka doesn't directly rely on Zookeeper to assign replicas.
It stores metadata in Zookeeper, but leadership & reassignments are handled by the controller broker.

📌 So what exactly does Zookeeper do here?
In older versions (Zookeeper mode), Zookeeper helps with:

Storing broker list & state

Controller election

Notifying Kafka when broker status changes

But Kafka’s controller broker does the actual reassignment, using metadata stored in Zookeeper.

⚙️ In KRaft Mode (No Zookeeper):
Kafka controller directly manages:

Failover

Reassigning replicas

Metadata updates (using Raft log)

More reliable, no split-brain, faster reaction

🛑 Does Kafka Automatically Reassign Replicas?
❌ Not by default.
Kafka does NOT automatically reassign replicas when a broker dies unless:

You manually run kafka-reassign-partitions.sh

Or you enable external tools (like Cruise Control)

✅ Why? Kafka assumes:

Broker might come back

Automatic rebalancing could overload network/disk

✅ So What Should You Do?
Monitor ISR list shrinkage

If a broker is permanently down, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --generate
kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --execute
Or use Cruise Control for auto-balancing

🔁 Final Summary
Scenario	Happens?	Who Handles It?
Broker/replica down	✅ Yes	Kafka notices via ZK/KRaft
Producer with acks=all fails	✅ If ISR < min.insync.replicas	Producer throws exception
Leader re-election (broker down)	✅ Yes (fast)	Kafka controller broker
Replica re-assignment	❌ Not automatic (unless configured)	You/Tools (e.g., Cruise Control)
In KRaft Mode	✅ All managed internally	Kafka controller via Raft



enable.idempotence = true
☑️ Guarantees:

No duplicate writes even after retry

Each message is written exactly once
