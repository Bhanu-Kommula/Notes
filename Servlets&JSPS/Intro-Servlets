**Servlets**

Servlets are Java programs, but instead of running them like regular Java apps with a compiler and main method, we run servlets on a web server. That means we need a web server like Apache 
Tomcat, Jetty, etc. Among these, Tomcat is one of the most popular.

Servlets are a server-side technology, which means they’re executed by the web server.

To put it simply, a Servlet is a Java-based web component that runs on the server (inside a container like Tomcat) and is used to generate dynamic content—like HTML, JSON, etc.—based on 
client requests.

Servlets are mainly used for handling HTTP requests on the server side and generating dynamic responses. 
So,
	•	When a user interacts with a webpage (say clicks a button or submits a form), a request goes to the server.
	•	A servlet handles that request on the server.
	•	It processes the data (maybe talks to a database or performs some logic).
	•	Then it generates a dynamic response—usually HTML, JSON, or XML—and sends it back to the browser.

We use servlets to:
	•	Handle web requests (like form submissions)
	•	Talk to databases
	•	Generate dynamic content (HTML/JSON/etc.)
	•	Serve as the backend logic of a web application

If we want to send anything to the backend or get something back from the backend, we need something like Servlets to handle it.
